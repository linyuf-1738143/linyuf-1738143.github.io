	<p><img src="steak.jpg" style="width:250px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">This beef steak recipe from Kevin Mangeolles delivers an elegant main course, as the beef is paired with mushroom pur√©e and potatoes cooked with bacon. The inventive beef tea brings further beefy richness to this dish, flavoured with dried ceps and thyme. Creating this dish requires a good amount of planning and preparation, so it's a good idea to prepare some of the elements, such as the potatoes and the beef tea, ahead of time. The finished meal will be incredible and worth the effort.</p>>
